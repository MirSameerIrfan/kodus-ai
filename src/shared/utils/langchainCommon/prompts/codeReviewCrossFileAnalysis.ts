# Cross-File Code Analysis
Analyze the following PR files for patterns that require multiple file context: duplicate implementations, inconsistent error handling, configuration drift, and interface inconsistencies.

## Input Data
- Array of files with their respective code diffs from a Pull Request
- Each file contains metadata (filename, codeDiff content, language)

## Input Files
${JSON.stringify(payload?.files.map(file => ({
    fileName: file.file.filename,
    codeDiff: file.file.codeDiff
})), null, 2)}

## Analysis Focus

### DUPLICATE_IMPLEMENTATION → refactoring
- Same logic implemented across multiple files in the diff
- Similar functions/methods that could be consolidated
- Repeated patterns indicating need for shared utilities

### ERROR_HANDLING_MISMATCH → error_handling
- Different error handling patterns for similar scenarios across files
- Inconsistent error propagation between components
- Mixed approaches to validation/exception handling

### CONFIGURATION_DRIFT → maintainability
- Hardcoded values duplicated across files that should use shared constants
- Similar configurations with different values
- Magic numbers/strings repeated in multiple files

### INTERFACE_CONSISTENCY → potential_issues
- Function signature changes not reflected in usage within the diff
- Behavioral changes without updating calling code
- Inconsistent API usage patterns across files

## Analysis Instructions

1. **Compare code diffs across all files** to identify:
   - Duplicate or highly similar code blocks
   - Inconsistent implementation patterns
   - Repeated constants or configuration values
   - Interface usage inconsistencies

2. **Focus only on cross-file issues** that require multiple file context:
   - Skip issues detectable in single-file analysis
   - Prioritize patterns that span multiple files
   - Look for opportunities to consolidate or standardize

3. **Provide specific evidence**:
   - Reference exact file names and line ranges
   - Show concrete code examples from multiple files
   - Explain the relationship between files

## Output Requirements

1. **JSON format must be strictly valid**
2. **For code blocks in JSON fields**:
   - Escape newlines as \\n
   - Escape quotes as \\"
   - Remove actual line breaks
   - Use single-line string format

Example format for code fields:
\`\`\`
"existingCode": "function example() {\\n  const x = 1;\\n  return x;\\n}"
\`\`\`

## Output Format

Generate suggestions in JSON format:

\`\`\`json
{
  "relevantFile": "primary affected file where suggestion will be posted",
  "relatedFile": "secondary file that shows the pattern/inconsistency",
  "language": "detected language",
  "suggestionContent": "detailed description including all affected files and specific line numbers",
  "existingCode": "problematic code pattern from multiple files",
  "improvedCode": "proposed consolidated/consistent solution",
  "oneSentenceSummary": "brief description of the cross-file issue",
  "relevantLinesStart": number,
  "relevantLinesEnd": number,
  "label": "refactoring|error_handling|maintainability|potential_issues",
  "rankScore": "0"
}
\`\`\`

## Important Notes

- **Only report issues that require cross-file context**
- **Include evidence from at least 2 files**
- **Focus on actionable improvements**
- **Prioritize high-impact consolidation opportunities**
- **Language: All suggestions and feedback must be provided in ${payload?.language || 'en-US'}**
